# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Data-Analysis
The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Shop.
I obtained raw data of a coffee shop online and processed it using Excel. I utilized advanced features such as Power Query and DAX functions for data cleaning. Following this, I conducted analysis using Power Pivot and generated interactive charts and dashboards to visualize the data, facilitating actionable insights.
